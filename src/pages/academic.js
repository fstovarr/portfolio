            From the start of my secundary education, my dream was studying at
            Universidad Nacional de Colombia. I had heard a lot of magical and
            interesting things about this university. When I reached my last
            year, I was sure that I was to approve the exam that I needed to do
            to start studying here. All the hard work I did in school was richly
            rewarded, I had a good score in the test, thus could choose my
            preferred carrer.
          </p>
          <p>
            These 4 years have been marvelous, the amount of things I learned
            here are unimaginable, not only with respect of my career, but also
            with respect of the life. Also, the interest of the university to
            build a better society is inspiring, I have strong fascinations
            about these topics, and the different points of view that I have
            known are invaluable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that I'm leaving this institution, I feel a little bit of
            nostalgia and sadness, but I'm quite sure new challenges will come,
            and I will learning wherever I will be.

                The strong abilities I have regarding programming and software
                engineering are a powerful tool to explore some fields of my
                carrer which are very interesting for me.

                The first of them is <b>Machine Learning</b>. Machine Learning
                is a branch of computer science where the main goal is provide
                to a computer machine of something similar to the human
                intelligence. Since early semesters I was studying by myselft
                this topic, taking online courses, reading blogs and books, and
                I could learn many techniques, models and paradigms that allow
                me solve some not-easy problems using a computer.

              <p>
                Furthermore, I have been interested in <b>Internet of Things</b>
                , that it's a field of the systems and electronics engineering,
                whose its main vision is to build a world where humans and
                robots are living in armony, even in the most simple daily
                tasks.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the school, I used to play to build some electronic devices
                using my knowledge of programming and using certain type of
                simple microcontrollers. Also I had the opportunity to take a
                course in Politecnico Gran Colombiano related with this topic,
                in my last year of school because my good results in a
                programming contest. This specific knowledge has allowed me to
                get a couple of professional projects related to this area.
              </p>

                Finally, <b>Software engineering</b> definitely is one my
                strongests skills. Those skills have brought me positive things,
                and have opened a lot of important opportunities in my life.
              </p>
              <p>
                By this reason, I have taken a couple of online courses about
                programming in several languages that I consider relevant, as{' '}
                <code>Kotlin</code>, <code>Dart</code>, <code>Ruby</code>, among
                others.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's important to mention, that this interest motivated me to
                take a subject in Universidad de los Andes, that is one of the
                best universities in this field in Colombia. There, I strengthen
                my knowledge related to mobile apps development, and the most
                important thing is that I was invited by the professor to work
                in his research group about mobile development. In the group, I
                was working in a tool of statical analysis of code to bugs
                detection in Kotlin.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unfortunately, I was only a couple of months working there
                because the schedule of the research group overlaped with a
                subject of my Undergraduate program.

                Winners of Celestini Program: a competition which main idea is
                empowering students to solve local issues using technology. My
                job was to lead a team of three students through planning,
                design, implementation, monitoring and closure of the project.
                The project involved:
