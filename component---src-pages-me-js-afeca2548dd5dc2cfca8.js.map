I'm a lifelong\n                learner. My main focus in these years has been in cultivating my\n                knowledge in several areas of life. At 15 years old, I learned\n                to code, and that changed my life. I was very interested in\n                robotic, software development, electronics, and several other\n                technical topics. Also, I love music, especially Latin music.\n                That was the motivation to learn dancing, playing a couple of\n                instruments, the history of some music genres, and learning how\n                to produce music someday. Another relevant aspect of my life is\n                community education. I worked for many years in a foundation,\n                trying to enhance education in marginal regions in my country.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </section>\n\n        <section>\n          <div className=\"image\">\n            <img src={cali} alt=\"\" />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"content\">\n            <div className=\"inner\">\n              <header className=\"major\">\n                <h3>Fabio, the engineer</h3>\n              </header>\n              <p>\n                I'm a senior student of Systems and Computing Engineering at\n                Universidad Nacional de Colombia. Also, I'm a software expert\n                with more than four years of experience. I have had experience\n                in software architecture and development, problem analysis and\n                solving, algorithm creation, and managing cloud services. I have\n                had the opportunity to develop a couple of platforms for\n                business purposes with satisfactory results, thanks to my broad\n                knowledge and technical expertise.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n          <div className=\"image\">\n            <img src={dream} alt=\"\" />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"content\">\n            <div className=\"inner\">\n              <header className=\"major\">\n                <h3>Fabio, the dreamer</h3>\n              </header>\n              <p>\n                Currently, I'm learning English and German. The idea with this\n                knowledge is to obtain a scholarship in order to do postgraduate\n                studies abroad. German culture is exciting for me, and I would\n                love to have the opportunity to travel there, either with\n                academic, professional, or personal interests. Finally, I need\n                to mention my interest in learning about entrepreneurship. My\n                dream now is to run my own company someday, help my family get a\n                better quality of life, and bring development to my country.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n          <div className=\"image\">\n            <img src={social} alt=\"\" />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"content\">\n            <div className=\"inner\">\n              <header className=\"major\">\n                <h3>Fabio, the socially conscious</h3>\n              </header>\n              <p>\n                Working in the Lazos - ETITC group, I was in charge of planning,\n                organizing, and executing various activities for educational\n                purposes in disadvantaged neighborhoods of my city. After that,\n                I was responsible for carrying out the annual work project and\n                leading a group of 10-15 people to execute this plan in the best\n                way. In my last year, I was selected to coordinate the group's\n                most significant activity in the year. In this activity, I lead\n                a group of roughly 80 people for one week. We also did popular\n                education projects in some distant towns of the main cities of\n                my country, e.g., Magangué-Bolívar, Villavicencio-Meta, San\n                Vicente del Caguán-Caquetá, Gigante-Huila, among others. There\n                we had the mission to prepare young people for state tests and\n                motivate them to continue their studies.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </section>\n      </section>\n    </div>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default Landing\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/family-9559501148efbbe3ac2cdd526ffb73da.jpg\";","import React from 'react'\n\nconst BannerLanding = ({ title, children }) => (\n  <section id=\"banner\" className=\"style2\">\n    <div className=\"inner\">\n      <header className=\"major\">\n        <h1>{title}</h1>\n      </header>\n      <div className=\"content\">{children}</div>\n    </div>\n  </section>\n)\n\nexport default BannerLanding\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
